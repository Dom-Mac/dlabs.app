## Decentralized labs website

The [dlabs](https://testnet.dlabs.app) website allows to redeem credits purchased on the dlabs store on Slice (TBD) in exchange for services provided by dlabs.

Credits available are checked real time based on products purchased, and are updated once job requests are submitted.

The app uses:

- Nextjs 13 & React 18
- Sign in with Ethereum authentication flow
- Notion API integration
- Discord integration

### Database storage

We use Supabase to store users' billing and contact info. Soon we'll also use it to handle auth
